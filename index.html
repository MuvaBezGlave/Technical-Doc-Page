            <h1>UX Design</h1>
          <p>
            As we become more reliant on machines and software in our day-to-day
            lives, usability and accessibility have become really important.
            This is where UX and UI come into play. We’ll take a look at how
            they work and how to use them.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              UX stands for User Experience, and, as the name suggests, UX
              design encompasses the end-user’s interaction with the company,
              service, or products. It’s worth mentioning here that this process
              can be applied to just about anything – from street lamps to
              websites. In theory, it’s a non-digital practice that focuses on
              the overall feel of a product or service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you’re wondering which one is more important, the fact of the
              matter is that they’re both as important as each other. Everyone –
              from developers to users – wants something that looks great and is
              also eminently usable. This is UI and UX manifest. While there are
              applications for one and not the other, the best results occur
              when they’re used together.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              So the benefits of UI and UX for business are numerous – and with
              the competition in the global market being what it is, getting
              both right is essential. To use another analogy – UI is the icing
              on the UX cake. If one part of the whole product doesn’t quite go
              to plan, the product as a whole could end up being spoiled.

              <h1>CSS</h1>
              <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for
            describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout,
            and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS
            is designed to make style sheets for the web.
          </p>
          <code>p { color: red; }</code>
          <p>
            CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the
            design, layout and variations in display for different devices and
            screen sizes.
          </p>
          <code>
            body { background-color: lightblue; } h1 { color: white;
            text-align:center; } p { font-family: verdana; font-size: 20px; }

          JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting
          language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many
          non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
          Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an
            application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
            events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful
            libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so
            many others.
          </li>
          <code>
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
              <body>
                <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>

                <p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>

                <button
                  type="button"
                  onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'
                >
                  Click Me!
                </button>
              </body>
            </html>
          </code>
          <li>
            Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to
            communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
            manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most
            famous these days is node.js.

        <article>
          <p>
            Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically
            resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on
            all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                To create a responsive website, add the following <meta /> tag
                to all your web pages:
              </p>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be
                responsive and scale up and down:
              </li>
              <li>
                If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale
                down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its
                original size:
              </li>
              <li>
                The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the
                "viewport width".
              </li>
